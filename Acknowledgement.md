The idea and implementation of this site could not have been possible without the existing great projects out there and the great people who have come to help and inspire:

- [Ken](https://github.com/KenLSM) who has been running RK together with me since Oct 2018, who leads all the fine work done at RK
- [Huijing](https://chenhuijing.com) for being the first one to look at this site and all the ideas / suggestions on styling, then all the brilliant work in designing, bouncing off ideas, and messing around with this site. This site would have been much less colorful without you
- [Nut](https://github.com/nutstick) for showing me all the possibilities with GraphQL queries and helping setting everything up!!
- [Thomas](https://github.com/thchia) for collaborating on this site, cannot wait to see what we'll create together down the road :))
- [meowni.ca](meowni.ca) for the inspirations ðŸ’œðŸ¦„
