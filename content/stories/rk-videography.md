Have you ever wondered, how are we able to create video contents? We didn’t simply pop our cameras on the tripod and punch in the red button — that’s a recipe for disaster. We’ve learnt that video-graphing is all about the pre-production. Most of the things that goes on screen have already been prepared and brief to the actors(read: speakers) on set. And the job of the video-graphing team is to make the speakers look their best in the video.

When our speaker presents, we want to know how they stand. We place our rostrum in relation to where the camera and the spot where the speaker stands, ensuring that suitable amount of light, not too little or too much, lands on the speaker and is not contrasted by another strong light. In our first few recordings, we learnt that the projection screen is a strong source of light, as reflects much of the light from the projector. Thus, we to avoid having the screen in frame. 

The speaker might not be aware that moving during their presentation may have consequences on how they will be captured on the video. Remember the point above? If the speaker moves towards the screen and attempts to point on the screen, it will be inevitable that the screen comes into the frame. Thus, we do dry-runs, in order to uncover such activities in their presentation. More than often, we can avoid the need of the speaker to move — by capitalizing the use of appropriate animation to lead the eyes of the audiences.
